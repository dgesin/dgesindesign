                        <p>I remained on the Trademark Next Generation (TMNG) project through the beta release, when I was reassigned to lead design on another effort. During this time, I worked on the interaction and visual design, wrote the CSS/LESS for the application, coordinated the usability, 508, and user acceptance testing, and assisted with designing both the TMNG Pattern Library and USPTO UI Design Library.</p> 
                        <p>The TMNG application was created to streamline the examination process for examiners. When I came on, the project had already been going for a couple years and had grown to include designers and developers from multiple companies. I was originally brought on to assist developers by writing the CSS (using LESS) and designing a pattern library to be used by the various teams involved. As the project progressed, my role increased to include a wide range of activities.</p>
                        <p>My role first expanded to assisting with the coordination of usability testing. While testing, we made a point to include developers and project management in the process. This unified the design and development teams which helped to create a more agile process moving forward.</p>
                        <p>The pattern library began with the goal of creating consistency within the TMNG project. We were eventually asked to assist with a larger effort, the development of the USPTO UI Design Library. This library is now the cornerstone for all USPTO products.</p>
